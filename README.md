# Boxigon
Connect, explode, create, destroy, and ruin the universe.

## About

**Boxigon** is a free 2D physics sandbox game, that also allows you to create games of your own. With easily accesable APIs and toolkits, to build your dream, with zero coding knoweldge needed. And no ai droids either.

## How to build

#### Prerequisites

Firstly you'll need a copy of Python, since of course the entire game is written in it. [Get that here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
(*Python 3.14+*)

Once you have Python and PIP, run the following command.

```bash
pip install -r requierments.txt
```

This command will fetch and install the required libraries, including **pypresence**.


> [!NOTE]  
> PyGame is the only requierd library, but the game won't start up without pypresence but you can still run the game without a Discord client ID.

then simply run

```bash
python3 app.py
```
or something alike, and enjoy!

One key thing that you may know already is that building from sourse means you won't be provided auto updates, you'll have to rebuild every time a new build releases.
